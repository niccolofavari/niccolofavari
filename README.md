# I'm Nick (aka Nikles)

👋 Hi there, I'm a **Professional Software Engineer** 💻. By day, I work as a *PHP Developer* 🌞, and in my free time, I pursue my passion for **Game Development** 🎮. I love to dabble with various game engines like **Godot**, **GameMaker Studio**, and **PyGame** to create thousands of unfinished prototypes.
