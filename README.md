# I'm Nick (aka Nikles)

👋 Hi there, I'm a **Professional Software Engineer** 💻. By day, I work as a *PHP Developer* 🌞, and in my free time, I pursue my passion for **Game Development** 🎮. I love to dabble with various game engines like **Godot**, **GameMaker Studio**, and **PyGame** to create thousands of unfinished prototypes.

Sometimes I release resources like open-source platformer engines or scripts, either here on github or on *itch.io* 🕹️

I also write articles for my game dev blog [Nikles.it](https://nikles.it) and maintain a digital garden of my own at [Niccolofavari.com](https://niccolofavari.com).

Currently working on a 📖 *book about PyGame*!

Pronouns: *He/him* 🚹
